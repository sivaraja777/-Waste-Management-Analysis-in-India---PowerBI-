# **SIVARAJA WASTAGE PROJECT**

## **Project Overview**
The **SIVARAJA WASTAGE PROJECT** is a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize waste management data across different Indian cities and districts. The project aims to provide actionable insights into waste generation, recycling rates, landfill locations, and cost efficiency in waste management.

## **Objectives**
- **Analyze Total Waste Generated Per Day** across multiple cities.
- **Track the Cost of Waste Management** and find opportunities for cost reduction.
- **Identify Key Landfill Locations** and their impact on waste distribution.
- **Evaluate Recycling Efficiency** by waste type (Plastic, E-Waste, Organic, Hazardous, etc.).
- **Assess Municipal Efficiency Scores** to compare waste management performance in different districts.

## **Features**
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Includes multiple visuals like bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and maps.
- **Geospatial Mapping:** Displays landfill locations across India.
- **Filter & Slicer Options:** Allows users to filter data by city, waste type, and year.
- **Data Trends Over Time:** Analyzes waste generation trends from 2019 to 2023.
- **Comparison of Municipal Efficiency:** Ranks cities based on their efficiency scores in waste management.
